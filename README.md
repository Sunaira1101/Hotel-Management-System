<h1 align="center"><b>Hotel Management System</b></h1>

• Hotel Management System is a web-based system that helps users to get
information about our hotel, learn about its services, browse through a wide
range of rooms, and later on book a room that suits their preferences.

• On our website, there will be two components – one for users, the other for
admins.

• This project will have a sign up system which will help different users to make
an account separately, and later login when they want to book a room.

• Likewise, this project will have a login system which will help different admins
to sign in separately. Admins and users will use their own personal email
address to sign up or login.

• Admins will receive user queries, booking details, user information. Basically
the admin will control the whole hotel management system, such as
adding/deleting/updating rooms while users can only view the hotel services
and book available rooms.

For this project we used PHP for backend, PHP and CSS for Frontend and
MySQL for the database.
